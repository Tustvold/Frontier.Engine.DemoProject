Frontier.Engine.DemoProject
===========================

##Description

A very barebones project that shows how to get everything setup and demonstrates some of the functionality of the engine.

A more detailed set of examples will likely be added in the future.

## Installation

This project uses CMake and so it should just be a simple case of setting ${REPO_ROOT} as the source code directory and $[REPO_ROOT}/Build as the location to build the binaries in CMake. This will generate the build files required to compile with your chosen build system.
